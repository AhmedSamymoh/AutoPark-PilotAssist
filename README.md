# AutoPilot-ParkAssistst
---
AutoPilot ParkAssist is an advanced self-parking system designed to make parking in tight spaces effortless. This project utilizes a combination of Raspberry Pi, STM32, camera, ultrasonic sensors, and a compass to provide real-time feedback during parking maneuvers. The entire system is open-source, fostering innovation and collaboration in the development of autonomous parking solutions.

## Version
- **Version 0**: Manual Phase Park Assist using Arduino nano test and Bluetooth module HC-05 and L298n

## Hardware Setup

To get started with AutoPilot ParkAssist, follow these steps for setting up the required hardware components:

1. **Raspberry Pi:** Ensure you have a Raspberry Pi board.

2. **STM32:** Obtain an STM32 microcontroller for interfacing with sensors and controlling the parking system.

3. **Camera:** Connect a compatible camera for visual input.

4. **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Include ultrasonic sensors for proximity detection during parking maneuvers.

5. **Compass:** Integrate a compass to provide directional information.
